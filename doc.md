# REST API
## REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface

## It is a software that allows two applications to communicate with each other over the internet and through various devices. Every time you access an app like FB or check weather , api is used.

## A RESTful API is an architectual style for an api that uses HTTP equests to access and use data.

## REST is not a programming language.

## Statelessness
### As per the REST (REpresentational "State Transfer) architecture, the server does not store any state about the client session on the server-side. Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, It includes all information necessary for the seryer to fulfill that request.
